we went on feb 15th at around 845 pm it was very noisy  crowded  packed but the food was sized appropriately we had a salad dishhuge  and chicken burger with fries    which came to around 25 including taxes and tips  we will not go there again because there were way too many tvs  we counted about 28 tvs in all  blasting away about every sporting event going on its a sports freaks heaven  not for us we didnt expect to have tvs blaring away during a meal  its either one or the other  its even uncomfortable thinking about it now  it was just too unpleasant the service felt more like an auction since no one was focused on making patrons feel comfortable meal times are to be enjoyed  not surrounded by tvs will not go there again even if someone paid us its not worth the money
